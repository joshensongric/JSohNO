🚀 JSohNO – The Ultimate AI-Optimized Encoding System

"AI-safe, token-efficient, lossless string transmission... without all the legacy baggage."





💡 What is JSohNO?

JSohNO is an ultralightweight, AI-optimized text encoding format that revolutionizes how large, unstructured text is processed for machine learning models. Inspired by DNA recombinant encoding, it reduces token usage by up to 87%, guarantees 100% API safety, and achieves near-lossless content retention even at extreme string lengths (up to 3.14M charToks).

> “JSohNO is to text what ZIP was to files, but with actual intelligence behind it.” – Someone important on Twitter



🔥 Why JSohNO?

🚀 Speed: Processes and recombines text with near-zero latency.

🛡 Safety: Guarantees API-safe text transmission without needing complex escaping.

🎯 Efficiency: Reduces API costs and token bloat for LLM interactions.

🤖 AI-First: Purpose-built for sending AI-compatible payloads without hallucinations.

🔄 Self-Contained: No dependencies. The encoding header includes all required mappings.


⚡️ How It Works

1. Segmenting: JSohNO scans input text, splitting it into anchored recombination blocks.


2. Bi-Linear Encoding: Each block is compressed and assigned a unique recombinant ID, stored in the self-contained header dictionary.


3. Reassembly: Decoding reconstructs text exactly, using our patented JSohNO fast-recombinant traversal™.



📌 Installation

npm install jsohno
